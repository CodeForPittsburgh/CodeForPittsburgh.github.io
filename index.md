**Code for Pittsburgh**, the Pittsburgh region's [Code for America Brigade](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), makes the Pittsburgh region a better place through the use of information and technology. Despite the name, we're not only focused on computer programming! We are a grass-roots organization that works as a civic relationship-builder and is inclusive of different interests, skill-sets, and communities. We foster inclusive connections between government, nonprofit, academic, for-profit companies, residents, civic technologists, analysts, designers, and many others. Our members use projects, events, and advocacy to improve communities and enable civic engagement in a fun, educational atmosphere.
