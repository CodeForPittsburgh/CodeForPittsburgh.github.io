**Code for Pittsburgh**, the Pittsburgh region's [Code for America Brigade](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), makes the Pittsburgh region a better place through the use of information and technology. Despite the name, we're not only focused on computer programming! We are a grass-roots organization that works as a civic relationship-builder and is inclusive of different interests, skill-sets, and communities. We foster inclusive connections between government, nonprofit, academic, for profit communities, residents, civic technologists, analysts, designers, and many others. Our members use projects, events, and advocacy to improve communities and enable civic engagement in a fun, educational atmosphere.
