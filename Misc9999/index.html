                    <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/codeforpgh" target="_blank">@codeforpgh</a> project reads the City of Pittsburgh Police <a href="http://communitysafety.pittsburghpa.gov/Blotter.aspx" target="_blank">Blotter</a> daily report, reads the .csv file and loads the data into a PostgreSQL database. The address geo-coding is done using the Allegheny County Address <a href="http://geodata.alleghenycounty.us/arcgis/rest/services/Geocoders/EAMS_Composite_Loc/GeocodeServer" target="_blank">REST </a> service. The Council District number comes from a PostGIS lookup using the addresses lat and lng. This is a daily manual process based on yesterday's data. You can also follow City of Pittsburgh Police Incident Data from the <a href="http://www.wprdc.org/" target="_blank">Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center</a> under Public Safety & Justice. </p>
