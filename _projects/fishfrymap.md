The **[Fish Fry Map](https://codeforpittsburgh.github.io/fishfrymap/)** is a project which Storyteller [Hollen Barmer](https://twitter.com/hollenbarmer) initiated on her own prior to joining Code for Pittsburgh. CfP members were able to give the project a technical boost, moving it from Google Maps to Leaflet/Mapbox. Custom cartography, toggles for Lunch, Alcohol, and Pierogies, and driving directions were added to give the map a Pittsburgh flavor.

Look for updated iterations of the project annually, and be sure to thank [Hollen](https://twitter.com/hollenbarmer) for her hard work!
