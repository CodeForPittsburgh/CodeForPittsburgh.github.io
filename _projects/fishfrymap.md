The **[Fish Fry Map](https://codeforpittsburgh.github.io/fishfrymap/)** is a project which Storyteller Hollen Barmer initiated on her own. Friends of Fish Fries members were able to give the project a technical boost, moving it from Google Maps to Leaflet/Mapbox. Custom cartography, toggles for Lunch, Alcohol, and Pierogies, and driving directions were added to give the map a Pittsburgh flavor.

Look for updated iterations of the project annually, and be sure to thank Hollen for her hard work!
