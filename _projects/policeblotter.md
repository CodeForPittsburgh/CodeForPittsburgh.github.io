The [**Police Blotter**](/PoliceBlotterDaily) was Code for Pittsburgh's longest running project. Lead tirelessly by [Mark Howe](https://twitter.com/mhowe0422), the project entailed the creation of scripts that scraped public police crime data from City of Pittsburgh `csv` files, parsed and loaded the text to a PostgresSQL database, geocoded it, and displayed the results on fully searchable map.

After 18+ months of careful stewardship, the public presence of the Blotter (and other factors) led to the City's Police Department working with the WPRDC to formally publish their [data directly in a standardized, open format](http://wprdc.org/crime/). 

Consider this one a mission accomplished. The blotter was retired in November 2016.
